/// available here — and instead validates and bookkeeps every call, recording the exact sequence
/// of order-sensitive calls (Play/Stop/SetVoiceParams) a real backend would have received.
/// Existing solely so AudioSystemUVE/AudioSourceSystemUVE can be built and unit-tested against a
/// real IAudioDeviceUVE& today; a genuine OpenAL-soft backend is future work once this environment
/// has the SDK and audio hardware it currently lacks.
/// Thread-safety: not thread-safe. Every method is intended to be called only from the main
/// engine/audio thread, matching AudioSystemUVE's own single-threaded frame contract.
