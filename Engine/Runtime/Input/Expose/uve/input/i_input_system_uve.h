/// IInputSystemUVE is the spec's `InputSystemUVE` (Part 7.7): abstract keyboard/mouse input plus
/// a named action-mapping layer (`InputActionUVE`/`InputBindingUVE`). The legacy action layer remains
/// keyboard/mouse-only for compatibility; bounded gamepad device snapshots are provided separately
/// by `GamepadInputSystemUVE`, while backend-neutral touch/gyroscope snapshots are provided by
/// `MobileInputSystemUVE`. Android/iOS polling, lifecycle, coordinate-system mapping, and gesture
/// interpretation remain outside this desktop-safe interface.
/// Unlike ICollisionSystemUVE/IRaycastSystemUVE, an implementation is expected to be stateful
/// (current/previous device state for edge detection) and driven once per frame via UpdateUVE() —
/// closer in shape to IEventSystemUVE's own "self-contained stateful service" than to
/// RaycastSystemUVE's pure-stateless-query shape. There is deliberately no second "Null"-style
/// implementation: no real backend (WindowManagerUVE) exists yet to abstract away, so the single
/// concrete InputSystemUVE — which never touches real hardware, only consumes explicitly pushed
/// state — already is the sandbox-appropriate implementation. A future real backend calls the
/// same Set*StateUVE() methods below directly, rather than implementing a second variant of this
/// interface.
/// Thread-safety: the injection methods (Set*StateUVE()) are safe to call from any thread,
/// matching IEventSystemUVE::QueueEvent()'s contract — a future real backend would call them from
/// a platform/window thread. UpdateUVE() and every query method are main-thread-only, matching
/// IEventSystemUVE::DispatchQueuedUVE()'s contract.
