/// enum (General/Renderer/Animation/Physics/ECS/Audio) could be introduced alongside or in
/// place of it later without reshaping this struct — no such enum exists yet.
/// `allocationId` is a unique, monotonically increasing identifier assigned by the recording
/// IMemoryTrackerUVE (never supplied by the caller) — it survives pointer reuse after a free,
/// so leak reports and future crash-report/profiler tooling can key off it instead of a raw
/// pointer.
/// Thread-safety: value type, safe to copy/move freely; holds no shared state.
