/// object to IRenderDeviceUVE::SubmitUVE() as a batch — mirroring Vulkan/D3D12/Metal's explicit
/// command-list model (the spec's actual named target backends) rather than issuing draw calls
/// immediately as the scene is walked. Obtained via IRenderDeviceUVE::CreateCommandBufferUVE(),
/// never constructed directly.

/// SubmitUVE() exactly once; recording the same instance from multiple threads concurrently, or
/// reusing it after submission, is undefined. Parallel recording across ThreadPoolUVE workers
/// (e.g. one secondary command buffer per worker, merged at submission) is a future increment,
