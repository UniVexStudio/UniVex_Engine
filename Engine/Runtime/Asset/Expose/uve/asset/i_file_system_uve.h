/// I/O, virtual file system (VFS)"): zero or more mounts (real directories, or `.uvebundle`
/// archives) are searched, in descending-priority order, to resolve a virtual path. A virtual
/// path is a forward-slash-separated string with no leading slash (e.g.
/// `"textures/rock.uvetex"`); mount prefixes use the same shape (`""` = root). A virtual path
/// matches a mount iff it equals the mount's prefix or starts with `prefix + "/"` — matching is
/// always on whole path segments, so a mount at `"tex"` never matches `"textures/rock.uvetex"`.
/// This lets a loose directory mount transparently override (or be overridden by) a bundle
/// mount at the same or a covering prefix, simply by priority — the classic PAK-file/mod-override
/// pattern. Deliberately standalone this increment: `AssetDatabaseUVE`, `uve_file_envelope_uve`,
/// `AssetImporterUVE`, and `SceneSerializerUVE` are unaffected and still take a raw
/// `std::filesystem::path` directly — this VFS proves itself against `AssetBundleUVE` only; wider
/// adoption is future-increment work.
/// Thread-safety: thread-safe. Every method is guarded by an internal mutex, matching
