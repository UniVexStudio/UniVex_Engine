// A minimal, additive, extern "C" boundary letting a non-C++ host (initially: a C# assembly
// embedded into the same OS process via .NET's native hosting API) drive EngineCoreUVE's
// lifecycle and read the same live viewport GL texture Engine/App/src/editor/main.cpp's
// ViewportPanelBackendUVE already produces for the C++ ImGui editor. Deliberately does not wrap
// EditorUVE/EditorBridgeUVE yet - that lands once a managed panel actually needs the bridge's
// snapshot/dispatch surface (Scene Hierarchy/Inspector). This first slice only has to prove two
// things end-to-end: the native-hosting call path works, and the real GL viewport texture this
// process's own GL context produced is visible/usable from managed code without any cross-context
// sharing (both sides run on the same thread, in the same process, against the same current GL
// context - see this library's own CMakeLists.txt comment for why that removes the sharing problem
// entirely rather than working around it).
//
// No native window/GL/ImGui type crosses this boundary as a parameter or return type - only
// opaque handles and plain scalars - matching the same "no raw handle crosses the boundary"
// discipline already established by EditorBridgeUVE for the non-viewport panels.
